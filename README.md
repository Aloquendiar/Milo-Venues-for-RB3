# Welcome Milo Venues for RB3
This repository is focused on providing updated venues for pre-RB3 songs.
# Available Updates
- Classic Midi Venue: For most, this will be the easiest option, but it won't be the prettiest.
- Milo Venue: This venue is ideal if you want to see different cuts between instrument variants. This will also change the animation genre, so this is the best option. It allows Wii, PS3 or Xbox players on older versions to play with functional venues.
- DX Venue: This is intended to use the variants feature I created for RB3 DX. This version is similar to Milo, but you can't choose another genre unless you modify the DTA. This version is not recommended for use in "cons" because it doesn't contain the classic "VENUE" track.
# Contributing
If you would like to contribute with any updates, I am open to receiving new venues created by the community.
